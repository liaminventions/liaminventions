**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Waverider**

I am working on the XPL-32 (8 bit homebrew laptop)
and the emulator for it.

I also made a C64 intro!

Also i'm a coder in the demogroup Atlantis: https://csdb.dk/group/?id=240

I've got an update channel, where I will post the videos that go in my blog.

I make music as well, check out my music channel.

I am also part of FTC team #17346, The Taco Terminators, since 2019.
